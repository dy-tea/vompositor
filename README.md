# wlroots compositor written in V (WIP)

Currently implementing a basic compositor based off [tinywl](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/blob/master/tinywl/tinywl.c?ref_type=heads).

Contributions are welcome, as well as suggestions on how to improve the [wlroots bindings](src/wlr).

# Building
This project depends on the following packages:
- `wlroots-0.20`
- `wayland`
- `xkbcommon`
