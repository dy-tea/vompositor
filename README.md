# wlroots compositor written in V (WIP)

Currently implementing a basic compositor based off [tinywl](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/blob/master/tinywl/tinywl.c?ref_type=heads).

The pixman and xkbcommon bindings are autogenerated using [c2v](https://github.com/vlang/c2v), while the rest of the bindings are manual and therefore incomplete.

Contributions are welcome, as well as suggestions on how to improve the [wlroots bindings](src/wlr).
